NobbZ Moonlander layout
=======================

This is the layou to my Moonlander layout.

Currently the latest version is always as downloaded from the website configurator.
I have not yet actually done any real self coding for the layout, I just want there to be a version controll that does not depend on ZSA continuing their service.

The latest version can always be seen in [Oryx](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/gO34N/latest/0).

Nix-flake users can build this via `nix build github:nobbz/qmk_firmware#firmware`.

Pushing is also easily possible via `nix run github:nobbz/qmk_firmware#push`.
