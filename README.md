NobbZ Moonlander layout
=======================

This is the layou to my Moonlander layout.

Currently the latest version is always as downloaded from the website configurator.
I have not yet actually done any real self coding for the layout, I just want there to be a version controll that does not depend on ZSA continuing their service.

The latest version can always be seen in [Oryx](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/gO34N/latest/0)

<div style="padding-top: 60%; position: relative;">
	<iframe src="https://configure.zsa.io/embed/moonlander/layouts/gO34N/latest/0" style="border: 0; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%"></iframe>
</div>
